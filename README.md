# OnewheelEnhancer

OnewheelEnhancer is an iOS tweak runnable on jailbroken devices. 
Upon installing, it'll patch FutureMotion's official app to support background audio mode to enable speed alerts.

# Features

  - Live cells voltage tracking
  - Helps spotting weaks cells (higher cells are displayed in green, cells weaker by 0.03V will be in green, weakers than 0.06V in red)
  - Battery percentage calculable using voltage instead of BMS value (Useful if using an XXR-mod for example)
  - Speed alert settable. You'll receive a push notification along with an alarm ringing from your phone if you exceed this max speed
  - Displays original cells type delivered with your BMS. If you replaced your battery pack with another cells type, a wrong information will be displayed.
